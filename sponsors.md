## Sponsorship the CISO Track

Sponsoring at the CISO Track provides you with first-hand feedback from executive leaders (CISO/CSO) for the problem your company is working to solve. It is held in a closed-door format, under the Chatham House rule (no attribution of quotes to individuals or their organization).
Sponsors get to send a subject matter expert (SME) to start the session off in a 10 minute opening. Following this, the core of the session commences, which is a peer-discussion between the participants and is moderated by our track chairs. The SME is not part of the discussion, unless asked specifically by participants to do so.
Sponsors also get to send one delegate in addition to the SME. The delegate is not part of the discussion or the opening, and is there in order to capture discussion points and better document them for the sponsor.

If you would like to apply to sponsor a CISO Track event in the future, please fill in the application form below. Note that if the problem domain you are covering is now shown, you can add it manually and we will make sure to include it in future participation applications.
