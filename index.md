## About

The modern security executive needs to handle a complex world of technology, policy, politics, and business; all while supporting their organization in becoming more resilient, innovative and customer focused. This evolution from the “IT Security” person to a proper C-suite executive is not only challenging to the individual at the helm, but also the industry at large.

**The CISO Track** aims to provide our participants with a closed-door environment where sharing information and practices around a select number of topics is done properly. This isn’t about some vendor pitch, nor is it about sitting and having someone talk at you for 45 minutes. It is about a discussion between peers, curated by peers, around topics presented briefly (10-15 minutes) by vetted industry practitioners. What’s a vetted industry practitioner? They’re speakers who have agreed not to pitch or sell products, and their presentation has been reviewed and pre-approved by the program committee.

## RSA Conference 2020
We plan to hold the second CISO Track during RSA Conference in February 25th, 2020.

Applications for registration is [available here](https://forms.gle/kc1uNB8Y8N7KRkL78). Please note that all fields are mandatory (including agreeing to the track terms, privacy statement, participation through the day, minimal donation, and Chatham House Rule). Note that participation is capped at 50, and we cannot guarantee that all applications will be accepted. As such, registration will be closed once we have secured registration for the track.

## Details

The CISO Track runs through a full business day (9am to 5pm), and includes networking breaks, as well as a participant-led open session (un-conference style). Throughout the day, we will cover different topics, which would be selected and tailored by the track moderators.

Additionally, we will conduct a participant-led, open session where the content is defined and moderated by participants – this is the un-conference aspect of the program. Throughout the day, participants will suggest topics, and we’ll pick one or two of them to discuss in-depth. The person suggesting the topic will act as moderator.

This ensures that everyone has a chance to learn and lead discussions with their peers. Given the nature of our event, we hope that this hybrid approach will foster thoughtful, open discussion among participants on topics that have been identified as most relevant to them.

Participation in the CISO track is limited to vetted individuals who hold an active full-time CSO/CISO position. The event itself will run  under the Chatham House Rule.

**Note**: For those of you not familiar, Chatham House Rule is defined as follows: “When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.”

Participants are expected to be highly engaged and contribute to the discussions held during the day in a meaningful way. We reserve the right to ask for a minimal donation (amount to be set per CISO Track event) to a 501(c)3 organization supporting the track. In order to ensure the effectiveness of this track, participation will be restricted to up to 50 individuals.

Vendor participation is limited to presenting the session topic, and vendors will have no access to any participant list and are restricted from pitching or following-up with participants. The entire day will have a curator who will take notes to produce anonymized proceedings from the track which would focus on the content discussed, and publish the vetted proceedings after the conference.

### BSidesLV 2019
