# Sponsorship

Sponsoring The CISO Track is unlike most corporate sponsorship opportunities at events. We provide our sponsors a simple model - they get to send a vetter SME to present the problem domain in which they operate (for 10-15 minutes), and then listen in to the discussion between the CISO/CSO participants. This unique model allows companies with a unique opportunity to set the main talking points and then gain access to data that’s rarely available even through “industry analysits”. SMEs are highly encouraged to engage directly with participants in the beginning of the session (fewer slides, more direct interaction), and are not allowed to pitch products/solutions, present marketing/sales materials, or approach participants for sales purposes after their session. Sponsorship is available based on the problem domains chosen for each event. For sponsorship information, statistics, and previous sponsor’s feedback please [check out our sponsors page][1].
