# About The CISO Track

<p class="bigger"><u>The modern security executive needs to handle a complex world of technology, policy, politics, and business; all while supporting their organization in becoming more resilient, innovative and customer focused. This evolution from the “IT Security” person to a proper C-suite executive is not only challenging to the individual at the helm, but also the industry at large.</u></p>


**The CISO Track** aims to provide our participants with a closed-door environment where sharing information and practices around a select number of topics is done properly. This isn’t about some vendor pitch, nor is it about sitting and having someone talk at you for 45 minutes. It is about a discussion between peers, curated by peers, around topics presented briefly (10-15 minutes) by vetted industry practitioners. What’s a vetted industry practitioner? They’re speakers who have agreed not to pitch or sell products, and their presentation has been reviewed and pre-approved by the program committee.
