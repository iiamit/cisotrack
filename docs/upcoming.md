# Upcoming Events

We are starting to test out the concept of regional events. In the current global landscape, we believe that the need for collaboration and sharing between CISOs not only remains, but is actually heightened. Additionally, SMEs and sponsors are vying for additional ways to listen to their customer base and in light of most conferences canceling their onsite events, are asking us for ways to participate. Based on these, we are going to test out our Regional CE events and roll out additional ones

> **Q:** What is this “CE” event going to look like? 
> 
> **A:** Good question! CE stands for “Coronavirus Edition”. The concept and nature of the CISO Track stays the same. However, to accommodate social distancing and other gathering limitations, CE events will be limited to 25 participants. Food > will be available in a “boxed” version. From an SME perspective - we will allow the SME to participate through Zoom (as we understand that SMEs are limited and typically bound to a particular geography) - but the same format applies - 10-15 minutes of the SME presenting the problem domain and bringing up proposed discussion topics, followed by 40 minutes of peer discussion moderated by the CISO Track staff. 

## TLV Regional CE

We are aiming to hold a regional CE event in Tel Aviv during the last week of June 2020 (originally planned for CyberWeek). Additional details will be available soon. Reach out to us for more information, propose an SME session, or donate a space to hold the event at. Additional information and application form are on the dedicated event page.

## DEN Regional CE

We are working on a schedule for the Denver, CO CE event, but plan to hold it in July 2020 - right after the TLV event.
