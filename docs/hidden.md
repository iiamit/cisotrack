This page isn't in the nav or frontpage

Questions for Mel:
- Should I switch to a one column layout when the screen is small? Do you have a breakpoint you would recommend for that?
- Do we want a custom favicon? Maybe the eye icon? If so, the icon wasn't in the zip I was sent, can you send it over?
